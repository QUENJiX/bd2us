                        <p>The Common App gives you five slots to list your awards and honors. This is your chance to show off. This is the section that provides third-party validation that you are as good as you say you are. It's one thing to say you're good at math in your essay; it's another thing to show them a Silver Medal from the National Math Olympiad.</p>

                            <p><strong>What if your trophy shelf is just a dusty corner of your room?</strong> Relax. Most people don't have a long list of international awards. This section is about being strategic and framing your achievements, big or small, in the best possible light.</p>

                        <p>But what if you haven't won a Nobel Prize? What if your trophy shelf is just a dusty corner of your room? Relax. Most people don't have a long list of international awards. This section is about being strategic and framing your achievements, big or small, in the best possible light.</p>

                        <h2>The Hierarchy of Awards: Not All Trophies Are Created Equal</h2>
                        <p>Admissions officers think in terms of scope and selectivity. An award is more impressive if it's harder to get and if the competition pool is larger. Here is the hierarchy, from most impressive to least impressive:</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Award Hierarchy (Most to Least Impressive)</h4>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>International Level:</strong> This is the holy grail. Winning a medal in an International Olympiad (IMO, IPhO, IOI), winning a major global competition like the Google Science Fair. If you have one of these, you are in a very, very good position.</li>
                                    <li><strong>National Level:</strong> This is also extremely impressive. Being a national champion in debate, placing in the top 10 of a National Olympiad, winning a national writing competition. This shows you are one of the best in your entire country.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Divisional/Regional Level:</strong> Good, solid achievements. Placing in a divisional science fair, being a regional debate champion. It shows you are a big fish in a medium-sized pond.</li>
                                    <li><strong>School Level:</strong> This is the most common type of award. "Student of the Year," "Top in Physics," "Principal's Honor Roll." Are these impressive? Not really on their own. But they are still important to list if you don't have higher-level awards. They show that you were recognized as a top student within your own school community.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <h2>What Counts as an "Award"? (It's Broader Than You Think)</h2>
                        <p>Don't just think of gold medals. An "honor" can be many things:</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-award"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Types of Awards & Honors</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Academic Honors:</strong> "Principal's List" for getting high grades, scholarships you received from your school or another organization, being selected for a special academic program.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Extracurricular Awards:</strong> "Best Delegate" at a Model UN conference, "Man of the Match" in a cricket tournament, "First Place" in a school art competition.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Leadership Recognition:</strong> Being selected as a Prefect or Head Boy/Girl is an honor. It shows the school administration trusted you.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h2>How to Fill Out the 5 Slots: Be Strategic</h2>
                        <p>You only have five slots. You have to make them count. Follow these rules:</p>
                        
                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-list-ol"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Strategic Award Listing Rules</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Order by Prestige:</strong> Always put your most impressive award first (International > National > Regional > School).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Be Specific and Add Context:</strong> Don't just write "Math Award." That's useless. Give the full name, the level of recognition, and, if possible, the selectivity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Combine School Awards if Needed:</strong> If you have a bunch of "Top in Subject" awards from your school, you can group them. For example: "Academic Excellence Award (School); 1st in Physics, Chem, Higher Math". This saves space for more unique honors.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Weak vs. Strong Award Descriptions</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "Debate Winner"<br>
                                    <strong>Strong:</strong> "Champion, National Inter-School Debate Championship (National)"</li>
                                    <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "Good Student Award"<br>
                                    <strong>Strong:</strong> "Principal's High Honor Roll (School, Top 5% of class of 300)"</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h2>"I Have No Awards." - Is My Life Over?</h2>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>
                            <p><strong>No. Calm down.</strong> Most people don't have a glittering trophy case. If you don't have 5 formal awards, that's perfectly fine. <strong>Do not make things up. Do not list fake awards.</strong> The admissions officers will find out, and your application will go straight into the trash.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>If you don't have formal awards, your achievements will be demonstrated in other ways:</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Alternative Ways to Show Achievement</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Through your Activities Section:</strong> The "impact" you demonstrated is your award. "Raised 50,000 Taka" is an achievement. "Grew club to 50 members" is an achievement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Through your Essays:</strong> You can write about a project you completed or a challenge you overcame. This is a story of achievement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Through Your Letters of Recommendation:</strong> A teacher describing you as "the best student I've taught in 10 years" is a powerful honor, even if it doesn't come with a certificate.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>It's better to have 1 or 2 genuine, well-described awards than 5 fake or insignificant ones. If you only have two awards, list those two and leave the other three slots blank. It shows honesty.</p>

                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-certificate"></i>
                            <p><strong>Final Word:</strong> This section is about providing proof. If you have proof of your excellence, show it. Be specific, be strategic, and be honest. If you don't have a lot of formal awards, don't panic. Your achievements should be evident throughout the rest of your application. The awards section is just the cherry on top, not the whole cake.</p>
