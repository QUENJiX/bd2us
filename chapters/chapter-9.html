                    <div class="content-block animate-on-scroll">
                        <p>Alright, let's assume your grades are great and your SAT score is high. Congratulations, you are now in a pile with 20,000 other applicants who are just as smart as you. So what separates you from the pack? What do you do when you're not studying? This is the "What else do you do?" test, and your extracurricular activities (ECAs) are your answer.</p>
                        
                        <p>American universities are not just admitting a brain in a jar. They are building a community. They want musicians for their orchestra, athletes for their teams, leaders for their clubs, and weird, interesting people who will make the campus a vibrant place. Your ECAs are your chance to show them you are not just another boring nerd.</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i>
                            <p><strong>The Golden Rule of ECAs: Depth over Breadth. Impact over "Joining".</strong></p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Common ECA Mistake</h4>
                                <p>I see the same mistake every year. Students send me a list of 15 clubs they "joined." What did you do in the club? "Uhh, I attended meetings." USELESS. Being a passive member of a hundred clubs is worth nothing. It's better to have 3-4 activities where you had a real, meaningful impact.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h2>The Four Pillars of a Strong ECA Profile</h2>
                        
                        <h3>1. Passion (Do you actually care?)</h3>
                        <p>Stop doing things because you think they "look good on a college application." It's a lie. The best ECAs are the ones you are genuinely obsessed with. If you love coding, spend your weekends building an app. If you love animals, volunteer at a shelter. If you love your culture, organize a massive Pohela Boishakh event at your school. Your passion will shine through in your writing and your descriptions. An admissions officer can smell fake passion from a mile away.</p>

                        <h3>2. Commitment (Did you stick with it?)</h3>
                        
                        <div class="info-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-calendar-check"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>What Real Commitment Looks Like</h4>
                                <p>Joining the debate club in Grade 12 is not commitment. Being in the debate club since Grade 9, practicing every week, and eventually becoming a mentor to the younger students? That's commitment. It shows you have follow-through. It shows you don't just quit when things get boring. Colleges are a four-year commitment; they want to see that you can handle that.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h3>3. Leadership (Did you make something happen?)</h3>
                        <p>Leadership is not just a title. Being the "President" of a club where you do nothing is meaningless. Leadership is about taking initiative.</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-crown"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Real Leadership Examples</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Did you see a problem and start a project to fix it? That's leadership.</li>
                                    <li>Did you organize an event from scratch? That's leadership.</li>
                                    <li>Did you mentor new members and help them improve? That's leadership.</li>
                                    <li>Did you start a club for something that didn't exist? That's the ultimate form of leadership.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h3>4. Impact (Did it matter? Quantify it!)</h3>
                        <p>This is the most important and most overlooked part. What was the result of your work? You have to use numbers. Humans are drawn to numbers.</p>
                        
                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Weak vs. Strong Impact Examples</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "I raised money for a charity."<br>
                                    <strong>Strong:</strong> "Organized a bake sale that raised 50,000 Taka for the local flood victims."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "I was in the programming club."<br>
                                    <strong>Strong:</strong> "Led a team of 3 to develop a new school event calendar app used by over 500 students."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "I volunteered at a school."<br>
                                    <strong>Strong:</strong> "Tutored 10 students in English for 2 hours/week, improving their average grades from a C to a B+ over one semester."</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Always ask yourself: "How can I put a number on this?" How many people did you help? How much money did you raise? How many events did you organize? How many hours did you dedicate?</p>

                        <h2>The "Spike": Your Secret Weapon</h2>
                        <p>A "spike" is when your activities are all focused around one central theme. This is how you stand out. Instead of being a "well-rounded" applicant who is pretty good at a lot of things, you become the "Computer Science God" or the "Social Justice Warrior" or the "Future Doctor."</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Spike Examples</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>The Computer Science Spike:</strong> You're the president of the programming club, you've won a national coding Olympiad, you've built three apps, and you have a summer internship at a software company.</li>
                                    <li><strong>The Social Justice Spike:</strong> You founded a club to raise awareness about climate change, you volunteer 10 hours a week at an NGO for street children, and you write a blog about human rights issues in Bangladesh.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>A spike makes you memorable. It tells the admissions officer exactly who you are and what you care about. For top universities, a strong, sharp spike is often more effective than being vaguely "well-rounded."</p>

                        <h2>How to Fill Out the Common App Activities Section</h2>
                        <p>You have 10 slots and only 150 characters to describe each activity. This is not a place for modesty. This is a place for action verbs and numbers.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Order by Importance:</strong> Put your most impressive activity first. The one where you had the most leadership and impact.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use Strong Verbs:</strong> Don't say "I was responsible for..." Say "Managed...", "Organized...", "Led...", "Founded...", "Developed...", "Raised...".</li>
                                    <li><strong>Be a Data Machine:</strong> Squeeze in as many numbers and concrete results as you can.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                            <p><strong>Example of a great description (149 characters):</strong><br>
                            <em>Founded school's first coding club; grew to 50+ members. Led weekly workshops on Python. Organized inter-school hackathon with 100+ participants.</em></p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>This is dense with information. It shows leadership (Founded, Led, Organized), commitment (weekly workshops), and massive impact (50+ members, 100+ participants).</p>

                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i>
                            <p><strong>Final Word:</strong> Your extracurriculars are your story. Don't just be a list of titles. Be a collection of impacts.
