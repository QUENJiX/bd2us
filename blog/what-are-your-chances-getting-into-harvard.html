                    <p>Lately I'm seeing lots of curious minds asking questions about whether they would be able to apply or get into Harvard, MIT or similar top schools. Which of course comes from a naive idea of how the holistic selection process works in such schools.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, I thought I should share the selection process of Harvard that was revealed through Asian Admission Lawsuit (2018).

                        <p>Way too vague to tell for sure, but some traits I often heard from Harvard alumni interviewers for students that received a 1 are "seemed like they would be amazing friends for their classmates", "didn't appear to treat college like a competition for grades", "wouldn't be intimidated by other bright and active people", and "memorable even 20–30 years later." Essentially, you must stand out as a person everyone wants to be around (which is highly subjective)... how you do that is really a unique thing for everyone.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Chances of Admission to Harvard Based on These Ratings</h2>

                    <h3>Candidates who Excel in One Dimension:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Academic rating of 1, no other 1s:</strong> 68% admission rate</li>
                        <li><strong>Extracurricular rating of 1, no other 1s:</strong> 48% admission rate</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal rating of 1, no other 1s:</strong> 66% admission rate</li>
                        <li><strong>Athletic rating of 1, no other 1s:</strong> 88% admission rate</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Multi-Dimensional (or "well-rounded") Candidates:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Three ratings of 2, one rating of 3 or 4:</strong> 43% admission rate</li>
                        <li><strong>Four ratings of 2:</strong> 68% admission rate</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Weaker Candidates:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No ratings of 1 or 2:</strong> 0.1% admission rate</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Overall Rating</h2>

                    <p>All of these ratings are combined by the application reader in an <strong>Overall rating</strong>, again from 1 to 6. This Overall rating is <strong>CRITICAL</strong> for admissions. The Overall rating is "not a formula" and doesn't involve adding up other ratings as average. It's a holistic grade. Harvard instructs readers to assign the score by "stepping back and taking all the factors into account, and then assigning that Overall rating."</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> How Overall Rating Works</h4>
                        <p>In reality, I suspect the grade is close to your top 2 scores - you can get a 1 on academic and personal and a 4 on athletic, and the 4 won't bring down your total score.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>The higher the Overall score you get, the higher your chance of admission. At Harvard, the average admissions rate is 5% to 6%. But students getting the highest score of 1 have a 100% admission rate; students getting 2+/2/2- have a 70% admission rate.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>How to Assess Your Own Profile</h2>

                    <p>Now that you understand Harvard's rating system, you can roughly assess where you might stand:</p>

                    <h3>Academic Rating Self-Assessment:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do you have near-perfect grades and test scores?</li>
                        <li>Have you conducted original research or published academic work?</li>
                        <li>Have you won prestigious academic competitions?</li>
                        <li>Do you have evidence of genuine intellectual curiosity beyond grades?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Extracurricular Rating Self-Assessment:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have you achieved recognition at the national level?</li>
                        <li>Are you a leader in multiple significant activities?</li>
                        <li>Do you have professional-level experience or achievements?</li>
                        <li>Have you made a measurable impact in your community or field?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Personal Rating Self-Assessment:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are you someone people genuinely enjoy being around?</li>
                        <li>Do you approach challenges with maturity and resilience?</li>
                        <li>Are you curious about other people and perspectives?</li>
                        <li>Do you contribute positively to group dynamics?</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Important Reality Check</h4>
                        <p>Remember, even with high ratings in multiple categories, admission is not guaranteed. Harvard could fill multiple classes with qualified applicants, so the final decisions often come down to creating a balanced and diverse class composition.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What This Means for Your Application Strategy</h2>

                    <p>Understanding Harvard's process can help you approach your applications more strategically:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Focus on depth over breadth:</strong> Better to excel significantly in fewer areas than to be mediocre in many</li>
                        <li><strong>Develop your personal qualities:</strong> Work on becoming someone others genuinely want to be around</li>
                        <li><strong>Seek national-level recognition:</strong> If possible, try to achieve recognition beyond your local community</li>
                        <li><strong>Tell a coherent story:</strong> Make sure your application presents a clear narrative about who you are</li>
                        <li><strong>Apply broadly:</strong> Even strong candidates should have multiple options</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Final Thoughts</h4>
                        <p>While this breakdown provides valuable insights into Harvard's process, remember that holistic admissions means that no single factor determines your fate. Focus on becoming the best version of yourself rather than trying to game the system.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Learn more about your specific college, including its location and other details, before making a decision. The admissions process is complex, and what works for Harvard may not be the same for other institutions you're considering.</p>
