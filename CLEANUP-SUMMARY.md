## Issues Still Remaining
- CSS file is still large (3,738 lines) - could be further modularized

## Recommendations for Further Cleanup
1. Split remaining CSS into logical modules (layout, components, pages)
2. Audit and remove any remaining unused CSS rules
3. Integrate chapter system or remove chapter files
4. Consider using a CSS preprocessor for better organization
5. Add CSS and JS minification for production builds
